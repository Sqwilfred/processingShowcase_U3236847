        <h2>Exercise Notes</h2>
        <p>This was a special flavour of difficult. I originally assigned the 'delete' process to <br>
        'RIGHT-CLICK' with conditional loops before realising I could just hijack the 'create' process with a <br>
        placeholder 'remove' function. The 'create' process is unrestricted, so I would say the sky is the limit <br>
        but it's really up to your CPU. </p>
